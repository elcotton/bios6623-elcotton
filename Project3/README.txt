BIOS6623: Project 3 ReadMe File


OBJECTIVE FOR THIS PROJECT:
The overall objective of this study is to identify the trajectories 
of onset of memory and other cognitive loss in persons at risk of 
developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Healthy, community dwelling, 
cognitively intact elders (n = 156, mean age at entry = 83 years) were enrolled and 
examined annually for an average of greater than seven years.  
Those who developed at least two consecutive Clinical Dementia Ratings (CDRs) = 0.5 were 
classified as having developed MCI.  We are interested in quantifying the annual rates of 
change on four cognitive tests in this cohort: The cognitive measures of 
interest are: (1) the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory I Story A, 
(2) Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II Story A; (3) category fluency for animals; and, 
(4) the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Block Design. Subjects need to be followed 
for 3 or more time points to be eligible for analysis.


Our general questions of interest are:

What is the rate of memory decline based on these measures over the aging process in healthy individuals?
What is the rate of memory decline based on these measures over the aging process in those diagnosed with MCI/dementia during the study?
Is there a period of time before the diagnosis of MCI/dementia in which the rate of the memory decline changes (or accelerates)?

Group 2: Question 3 is more specifically asking you to identify at what time prior to 
MCI/dementia diagnosis do the rates of decline change in those with MCI/dementia. 
There is an interesting paper by a leading Alzheimer’s Disease Researcher 
(Hall, 2000Preview the documentView in a new window), and we would like you 
to implement an analysis like what is in this paper.
