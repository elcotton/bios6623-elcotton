OBJECTIVE FOR THIS PROJECT:
The overall objective of this study is to identify the trajectories 
of onset of memory and other cognitive loss in persons at risk of 
developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Healthy, community dwelling, 
cognitively intact elders (n = 156, mean age at entry = 83 years) were enrolled and 
examined annually for an average of greater than seven years.  
Those who developed at least two consecutive Clinical Dementia Ratings (CDRs) = 0.5 were 
classified as having developed MCI.  We are interested in quantifying the annual rates of 
change on four cognitive tests in this cohort: The cognitive measures of 
interest are: (1) the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory I Story A, 
(2) Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II Story A; (3) category fluency for animals; and, 
(4) the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Block Design. Subjects need to be followed 
for 3 or more time points to be eligible for analysis.


Our general questions of interest are:

What is the rate of memory decline based on these measures over the aging process in healthy individuals?
What is the rate of memory decline based on these measures over the aging process in those diagnosed with MCI/dementia during the study?
Is there a period of time before the diagnosis of MCI/dementia in which the rate of the memory decline changes (or accelerates)?

Group 2: Question 3 is more specifically asking you to identify at what time prior to 
MCI/dementia diagnosis do the rates of decline change in those with MCI/dementia. 
There is an interesting paper by a leading Alzheimer’s Disease Researcher 
(Hall, 2000Preview the documentView in a new window), and we would like you 
to implement an analysis like what is in this paper.


CODE FILES:
BIOS6623_Project3_Cleaning
   This file imports the raw dataset (located at: C:/Users/cottonel/Documents/BIOS6623_AdvancedData/Project_Three/Project3Data.csv)
   and cleans the data and saves the clean dataset (located at: C:/Users/cottonel/Documents/BIOS6623_AdvancedData/Project_Three/Project3Data_Cleaned.csv)

BIOS6623_Project3_TableMaking
   This file imports the clean data and generates tableOne (demographics summary) and tableTwo (outcome summary),
   and saves these tables as CSV (located at: C:/Repositories/bios6623-elcotton/Project3/Reports).

BIOS6623_Project3_Graphing
   This file imports the clean data and generates "spaghetti" plots for each of the outcomes.
   It also subsets the clean data for each outcome to only those individuals who have 3 or
   more outcome measurements.

BIOS_Project3_ChangePointAnimal
   This file imports the clean data and generates a "spaghetti" plot of the animal score and time to 
   dementia diagnosis for individuals who had a dementia diagnosis. It also finds the change point 
   that is used in the mixed modelling.

BIOS_Project3_ChangePointBlockR
   This file imports the clean data and generates a "spaghetti" plot of the blockR score and time to 
   dementia diagnosis for individuals who had a dementia diagnosis. It also finds the change point 
   that is used in the mixed modelling.

BIOS_Project3_ChangePointMEMI
   This file imports the clean data and generates a "spaghetti" plot of the memI score and time to 
   dementia diagnosis for individuals who had a dementia diagnosis. It also finds the change point 
   that is used in the mixed modelling.

BIOS_Project3_ChangePointMEMII
   This file imports the clean data and generates a "spaghetti" plot of the memII score and time to 
   dementia diagnosis for individuals who had a dementia diagnosis. It also finds the change point 
   that is used in the mixed modelling.

BIOS6623_Project3_MixedModeling
   This SAS code runs the mixed modeling for each of the four outcomes. It uses four datasets saved
   in "C:\Users\cottonel\Documents\BIOS6623_AdvancedData\Project_Three". These datasets had the NA's
   manually changed in excel to "."---they were originally generated from the BIOS6623_Project3_Graphing


DOCS FILES:
BackgroundPaper_ChangePoint
   This file is a paper given to us by the investigators. They want us to run a similar analysis that
   is in this paper on our data.

   This file contains descriptions of each of the variables.
